# Script to set the vacuum chamber 
#
# Comments:
#  1) Line start with "#" is comment
#  2) The format of the vacuum chamber definition is 
#     start element, end element, minimum x, maximum x,
#     minimum y, maximum y.  
#  3) The first line is to define the global 
#     vacuum chamber limit around the ring, and 
#     the key words should be "Start","All".
#  4) To set the vacuum chamber, it is better to add two markers
#     in the lattice, one is before the first element, and the other
#     is after the end element for the vacuum chamber limit.
#  5) the units are meters for minimum x, maximum x, minimum y, maximum y
